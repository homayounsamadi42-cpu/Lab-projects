// Try This
// After running the program successfully, try:
// echo $account1->balance;
// Question
// Does it work?

// Answer: No
// Why?
//Because: the access type of $balance property is private which
//means this property is only accessable inside it's own class
//and can't be accessed outside of it's class.
